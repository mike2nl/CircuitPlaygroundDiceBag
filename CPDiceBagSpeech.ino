/*
The Circuit Playground Dice Bag The SpeakNRoll Version  - CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Tom Higgins & Sons 

Added code to speak out the results. As the speaker on the CP is tiny it is hard to make out the samples. We are working
on finding clearer and louder samples. 

TO select the type of die you would like to throw 
  First put the Select Switch in the proper position
  Then press the proper Button

Select Switch     Left Button  Right Button
----------------+------------+-------------+
+               | d100 (0-99)| d20 (1-20)  | 
----------------|------------|-------------|
-               |  d12 (1-12)| d06 (1-6)   |
--------------------------------------------

You can hold down the Button and it will flash through many tosses.
Release the Button and your results will show on the Circuit Playground as 
two (or one) lit NeoPixel

Red=Tens Place (0-9)
Blue=Ones Place (0-9)
Green=Tens and Ones are the same (00,11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99)

The NeoPixels are arranged from 0 - 9 . If you are holding your Circuit Playground with the USB port facing Up

0 is the top left NeoPixel closest to the USB port
1 is to the left of that
..
4 is the bottom let NeoPixel closest to the Battery Jack
5 is the bottom right NeoPixel closest to the Battery Jack
..
9 is the top tight NeoPixel closest to the USB port
